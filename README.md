# Automated tests - Telemedi website
## About this project
It was my first recruiting task to make you can find it [here](https://github.com/rkarolina/playwright_telemedi/blob/main/playwright/tests/zadanie_k_rozbicka.spec.ts). 
I had a backgroud from Selenium and Python and then Typescript and Playwright appeared!
Then I decided to develop my skills in Playwright framework and continue my jurney with it.
In this repo you will find more examples of automated tests.
